# Merged implementation acceptance

This record distinguishes implemented and tested behavior from deployment approval.
The source plan and remaining release work are tracked in
[core #58](https://github.com/jimhoyd-com/urlcode/issues/58).

## Exact merged baseline

The peer revisions CI verifies against are kept in [`peers.json`](peers.json);
the table below records the baseline this acceptance run was performed on.

| Repository | Main revision tested |
| --- | --- |
| core | `ed1db4cb42d3d25dfef241259375cfcfac0f3f6e` |
| UI | `97139bd2aa54ab7eb667b3d34adc9a280343c6ca` |
| auth | `faeb58a3b68a11a4b7a1e615155eb53cbe02c381` |
| admin | `edb6de85d2d3e12f664a7bbb1c05aab36cdf3f3c` |

This table records the acceptance run at the time it was performed. The peer
revisions currently verified by CI are the core/UI checkout pins in
`.github/workflows/verify.yml`, which are authoritative and may be newer than the
rows above.

The cross-package harness builds isolated source checkouts, packs compiled exports,
installs core into a fresh project, adds UI/auth, then adds admin. It exercises
account/session continuity, ordinary-user denial, administrator access and
revocation without source symlinks. The reproducible tools are
`urlcode-admin/scripts/pack-sources.mjs` and `scripts/clean-project-acceptance.mjs`
(both in the urlcode-admin repository).
Use exact reviewed commits and local archives; publishing is not required.

The merged-main v19 run passed all four package typechecks/builds and all 30
sequential clean-project checks (core 1, auth 8, admin 21). Temporary test hosts
closed successfully; existing review previews were preserved. The source manifest
records tarball integrity alongside these revisions.

## UI and browser evidence

The reviewed shared primitives use compiled Tailwind and server-HTML adaptations
of shadcn recipes. Auth/admin own their screens and domain copy. The separately
merged UI kit/template API is preserved; these screens currently use the shared
primitive renderer, not project template overrides.

Browser review covered separate identifier/password screens, safe error retries,
policy-aware signup steps, selected-email context, password guidance, conditional
authenticator controls, account/admin navigation, consistent headings, aligned
forms and actions, keyboard skip targets and 390px phone layouts without page
horizontal overflow. Inputs use 16px text. Light/dark/system preferences were
checked across navigation and reload. Registration completion is covered by HTTP
fixtures; the browser review stopped before entering a new credential.

## Remaining release validation

- Live Google/Apple/SES configuration and delivery: explicitly deferred by the
  project owner, not a local implementation blocker.
- Real browser/device WebAuthn coverage and full screen-reader/forced-colors/
  accessibility assessment; the browser walkthrough is not WCAG certification.
- Deployment load/soak, operational backup/restore and incident recovery drills.
  Synthetic backup tests are not evidence of a production recovery-time target.
- Operator sender monitoring and live health observations. Post-commit lifecycle
  callbacks remain best-effort, without a durable retry queue.
- Independent security assessment and native-language review of translations.

Do not interpret passing CI as independent review or hostile multi-tenant
readiness. Historical method timestamps remain unknown where they were never
recorded. Public lost-everything intake, recovery contacts and durable webhook
retries remain later scope. Credentials and test databases are never evidence
artifacts to commit.

## Automated implementation coverage

The auth test suite covers durable accounts/sessions, concurrent single-use authority,
registration/invitations/waitlist/consent, abuse bounds, signed provider fixtures,
passkey/MFA/recovery flows, account lifecycle, configuration migration and stale
workers, key rotation, backup/CLI, localization and HTTP settings responses.
See the focused files under `test/`, especially `auth-core.test.ts`,
`registration.test.ts`, `protocols.test.ts`, `signup-http.test.ts`,
`second-factor-flows.test.ts`, `backup.test.ts` and `scaffold.test.ts`.

[Combined auth integration CI](https://github.com/jimhoyd-com/urlcode-auth/actions/runs/35296669750)
passed verification on Node 22, 24 and 26 before merge. Private UI access is
configured; core #69 is resolved.
